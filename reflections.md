# Weekend

- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?

1. I built the canvas for my game, a factory function to put elements on the canvas and rendered my character. I also filled out many of the .md files, made an initial framework for the 'start' screen and built the start screen using Bootstrap (including a modal with the instructions).
2. Goals for today

- Build the toggle function to move between the 'start' screen and the game screen and another toggle button on the 'game' screen that moves back to the 'start' screen.
- Build wireframe for game screen.
- Render an asteroid to a random location on the canvas.
- develop the detectImpact() function
- Increase the amount of asteroids so 'x' number appear on the screen.

3. I struggled to render the player after building a factory function. I realized it was because I wasn't passing enough arguments into the parameters that factory function required so it was keeping the initial value of the player ship, which was nothing.
