# Weekend

- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?

1. I built the canvas for my game, a factory function to put elements on the canvas and rendered my character. I also filled out many of the .md files, made an initial framework for the 'start' screen and built the start screen using Bootstrap (including a modal with the instructions).
2. Build the toggle function to move between the 'start' screen and the game screen and another toggle button on the 'game' screen that moves back to the 'start' screen. I also hope to build a function that will render a random number of asteroids to random positions on the canvas.
3. So far I feel alright.
