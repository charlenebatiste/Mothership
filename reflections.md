# Monday

- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?

1. I built the canvas for my game, a factory function to put elements on the canvas and rendered my character. I also filled out many of the .md files, made an initial framework for the 'start' screen and built the start screen using Bootstrap (including a modal with the instructions).
2. Goals for today

- Build the toggle function to move between the 'start' screen and the game screen and another toggle button on the 'game' screen that moves back to the 'start' screen.
- Build wireframe for game screen.
- Render an asteroid to a random location on the canvas.
- develop the detectImpact() function
- Increase the amount of asteroids so 'x' number appear on the screen.

3. I struggled to render the player after building a factory function. I realized it was because I wasn't passing enough arguments into the parameters that factory function required so it was keeping the initial value of the player ship, which was nothing.

# Tuesday

- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?

1. I rendered the player and several hard-coded asteroids to the screen. I also got an asteroid to render to the canvas at a random location. I got the buttons working from the start screen to the play screen and vice-versa, and I built the wireframe for the play screen.
2. Goals for today:

- get a function written that will randomize the location of a set number of asteroids to the canvas.
- build the detectImpact function.

3. I expect to struggle building the loop for the asteroid randomizer as that's something I haven't been strong in in this course so I will have to take some time to review that and make the return variables of that loop available to be rendered.

# Wednesday

- [x] What did you achieve yesterday?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?

1. Yesterday I built an two asteroid functions and refactored the factory functioni for the spaceObject to create a more efficient way to assign and render the asteroids to the page in random locations. I also built a functioning scoreboard that changes the display during game play.
2. Today I will build and complete the detectImpact function.
3. I've realized I tend to make writting code harder than necessary and want to focuss on keeping evreything simple.
