# PROCESS WORK

## Initial Wireframes:

Initial Wireframe for Start Screen:

![Start Screen Wireframe](/assets/start-screen-wireframe.png)

Initial Wireframe for Play Screen:

![Play Screen Wireframe](/assets/play-screen-wireframe.png)

## FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

1. I would like to add some sort of animations to the asteroids so they move across the screen rather than remaining stationary.
2. I would like to build a blaster feature into the players ship to shoot elements out of the sky for extra points.
