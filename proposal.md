# Proposal of Game

The intent is to build a game in which a stranded alien ship returns to the Mothership that is waiting outside the planet's atmosphere.

# General Process

The game will use key bindings to move the player:
*spacebar to thrust `function moveUp()`
*left arrow keys to go right `function moveRight()`
*right arrow key to to right `function moveLeft()`
*up arrow key to shoot `function shoot()`

There will be other objects in the sky (asteroids, satelites) between the player and the Mothership and the player needs to avoid hitting them or be knocked out of the sky.

Shoot birds for extra points.

# Game Creation Method

I hope to try to create this game with css animations and keyframes.
